Project proposal: Analyze Yelp Philly restaurants (2005–2022) to build an end-to-end big-data pipeline (ingestion → storage → processing → analytics → visualization) using Apache Spark, Spark SQL/Hive-style tables, and MongoDB; produce operational insights (aspect sentiment, top issues, time-of-day complaint heatmaps).
